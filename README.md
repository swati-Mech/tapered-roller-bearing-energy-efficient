## 3️⃣ Optimized Bearing Configuration

| Component | Selected Material | Benefit |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Inner & Outer Races | SHX / SFX Steel | Higher fatigue life, heat resistance |
| Rolling Elements | Si₃N₄ Ceramic / Hybrid Balls | Lightweight, less wear, high-speed performance |
| Cage | Torlon (PAI) | Thermal stability & high mechanical strength |

**Why?**  
Better load distribution + lower friction + enhanced thermal stability.

## 4️⃣ Key Factors Affecting Energy Efficiency
- **Material Selection**  
  Affects wear resistance, friction coefficient & thermal conduction  
- **Friction Reduction**  
  Prevents heat buildup & improves rolling efficiency  
- **Load Distribution**  
  Reduces localized stress zones → longer bearing life  
- **Precision Manufacturing**  
  Smooth surfaces = reduced rolling resistance
