## Project Overview  
This project focuses on the optimization of a **tapered roller bearing** using advanced materials, thermal management, and friction-reduction strategies to enhance **energy efficiency, durability, and reliability under high-speed and high-load conditions**.

The design integrates:
- Advanced material selection
- Intelligent lubrication techniques
- Thermal analysis using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

Engineering design and simulation were carried out using **SolidWorks** for CAD modeling and **ANSYS** for thermal and structural analysis.

## Optimized Bearing Configuration  

| Component | Selected Material | Benefit |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Inner & Outer Races | SHX / SFX Steel | High fatigue life and heat resistance |
| Rolling Elements | Si₃N₄ Ceramic / Hybrid Balls | Lightweight, low wear, high-speed capability |
| Cage | Torlon (PAI) | High thermal stability and mechanical strength |

This configuration ensures **better load distribution, reduced friction, and enhanced thermal stability**.
